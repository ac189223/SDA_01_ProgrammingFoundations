 *
 * Why donâ€™t we call run() method directly, why call start() method?
 *
 * We can call run() method if we want but then it would behave just like a
 * normal method and we would not be able to take the advantage of multithreading.
 * When the run method gets called though start() method then a new separate thread
 * is being allocated to the execution of run method, so if more than one thread
 * calls start() method that means their run method is being executed by
 * separate threads (these threads run simultaneously).
 *
 * On the other hand if the run() method of these threads are being called directly
 * then the execution of all of them is being handled by the same current thread
 * and no multithreading will take place, hence the output would reflect the
 * sequential execution of threads in the specified order.
 *
 * Lets have a look at the below code to understand this situation.
